Entities learned from Wikipedia
===============================

Due to (reasonable) size limitations on Github, we cannot upload the complete
output here. If you are interested in the other files as documented, please
contact me. As is, I have only added the two most interesting output files
for use in text mining applications.

Or you download the source code and rerun the analysis yourself.

The plan is to make this data available via the university library,
which will also assign the data a DOI then for easier scientific citation.
But as such data is supposed to be static, I want to wait until I have
gathered some more experience with this data myself. Maybe I will run into
a shortcoming or limitation, and do another revision.

This data set contains some trademarked strings, including product and
company names. The use of these strings is covered by
[Fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use_%28U.S._trademark_law%29),
and are meant to help identify product names in free form text.

This is a human-readable summary of (and not a substitute for) the license:

You are free to:
----------------

 - **Share** — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
 - **Adapt** — remix, transform, and build upon the material

for any purpose, even commercially.

The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license
terms.

Under the following terms:
--------------------------

 - **Attribution** — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the
   license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable
   manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your
   use.
 - **ShareAlike** — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you
   must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
 - No additional restrictions — You may not apply legal terms or technological
   measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license
   permits.


You do not have to comply with the license for elements of the material in the
public domain or where your use is permitted by an applicable exception or
limitation.

No warranties are given. The license may not give you all of the permissions
necessary for your intended use. For example, other rights such as publicity,
privacy, or moral rights may limit how you use the material.


Rationale:
----------

The resulting data is derived from Wikipedia, but the text fragments
are small enough to not qualify for "art", but should be covered by
"fair use". The aim of this analysis is to find short fragments of text
that provide a reference to certain Wikipedia articles.

Nevertheless, I believe the Wikipedia license is the best choice for
licensing this data; not only because of consistency and being a safe choice.
