Entities learned from Wikipedia
===============================

Due to (reasonable) size limitations on Github, we cannot upload the complete
output here. If you are interested in the other files as documented, please
contact me. As is, I have only added the two most interesting output files
for use in text mining applications.

Or you download the source code and rerun the analysis yourself.

The plan is to make this data available via the university library,
which will also assign the data a DOI then for easier scientific citation.
But as such data is supposed to be static, I want to wait until I have
gathered some more experience with this data myself. Maybe I will run into
a shortcoming or limitation, and do another revision.
